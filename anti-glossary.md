Anti-Glossary of Intelligence
=============================

I've spend a lot of effort selecting terms to build a comprehensive description of intelligence. Some commonly used terms are conspicuously absent. But is their absence really as conspicuous it should be? Probably not. So I decided to make a point of listing terms that I believe are unhelpful in the discussions and descriptions of intelligence concepts.

## Disqualifying Reasons

I have chosen to avoid terms if they violate one or more of the following tests.

### Ambiguity

Some terms have multiple meanings, and which one is implied by the speaker may be difficult to discern by the listener. This should not imply that each separate definition of ambiguous terms are not clear and valuable, but that the specific definition of the term should explicitly declared. Or preferably, choose a different word with a more specific meaning.

### Misleading

Sometimes the technical definition of a word differs from its common definition enough that the implications of its common meaning bleed over and create misconceptions. Fox example the term *artificial neural network* implies a close relation to neurons - the cells of animal nervous systems. This is decidedly not the case, but every time it is a continuous fountain of misinformation. If common words are re-used for scientific discussion, both meanings must be reasonably close in key ways.

### Unnecessary Jargon

To avoid ambiguous and misleading terms, we could simply create a new word. Every kid who dreams of being a scientist wants to have something named after themselves. Unfortunately, using words that are not part of the common language of your audience will alienate them. Jargon excludes reasonable people from the discussion simply because they are not part of your club. Sometimes new concepts require new words, but only if no reasonable common word already exists.

### Unobservable

Terms must be defined in a way

Sometimes words are used that describe concepts that have already been definitively disproven or are inherently illogical or unobservable. Recycling bad ideas is not valuable. Only use words that have rigorous, observable definitions, unless your goal is to deliberately confuse and mislead.

## The Forbidden Words

*Forbidden* might be too strong of a term. If a term is only ambiguous or misleading, I see no problem continuing to use it in casual conversation.

### Love

Disqualifying reason: Ambiguous

### Emotion

Disqualifying reason: Ambiguous

### Stimulus

Disqualifying reason: Misleading

### Conditioning / Classical Conditioning

Disqualifying reason: Ambiguous

### Cognition

Disqualifying reason: Ambiguous, Jargon, Unobservable

### Proof

Disqualifying reason: Ambiguous

### The Soul

Disqualifying reason: Unobservable

I'm not saying I don't believe in *soul*. The passion of James Brown and African-American cuisine are undeniable. I mean *the soul*.
