Though we can only know a small part of our world and with limited precision, making factual observations and possessing strong beliefs are a powerful tools to overcome obstacles to our goals.

## Observe

Measurements are representations of a single property. A fact is a measurement corroborated by multiple independent observers.

An identification is when a collection of measurements matches a definition. For an identification to become a fact it must use a proper definition.

A proper definition has the following properties:

* Unambiguous
* Relies on factual measurements only
* No obvious false negatives
* No obvious false positives
* Must be as simple as possible

## Understand

We should strive to have accurate beliefs so the world we imagine is as close as possible to the real world.

A belief is a rule used to model our world.

An accurate belief is:

* Based on at least one fact
* Logically and unambiguously stated
* Predict a falsifiable observation
* A falsifying observation has not yet been made

## Overcome

We can use factual observations and accurate beliefs to solve problems and conquer the challenges blocking us from our goals.

Problem solving usually includes these steps:

1. Observe the problem, then define it clearly.
2. Limit range of possible solutions.
3. Select one possible solution.
4. Predict the solution's outcome.
5. Evaluate the quality of the outcome.
5. After an appropriate number of solutions are evaluated, decide on the best.
