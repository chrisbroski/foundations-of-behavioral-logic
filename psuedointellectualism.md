How to be a Pseudointellectual for Power and Profit
===================================================

Why bother with the time, effort, and pitfalls of being smart when it's so much easier and effective to appear smart? It's a good question because, there are benefits to appearing smart such as:

* Appear to be in possession of superior understanding and access to information
* Convincing others to obey your commands

Both of these can bring significant benefits to one's life - increasing the likelihood of acquiring a better-paying job and improving social status. But why?

First, what is understanding? It is the ability to model one's environment. If your brain contains accurate and thorough models, you can run possible actions through a simulation and predict the outcome. Better understanding means the imagined consequences of actions are more likely to be the actual consequences of those actions.

A true intellectual is someone that endeavors to improve their understanding of the world around them (or a narrow part of it) as much as possible. Typically the quest for understanding is just a hobby, performed for the enjoyment of discovery by ineffectual eggheads to impress each other with trivia. But it can have practical benefits. Decisions made using superior facts and understanding are more likely to be successful. You want these people working for you, and you should value their input when making your own decisions.

Improving actual understanding is hard. Even the best people can only discover modestly superior models in particular areas. Plus, this obsessive practice of discovery can distance themselves from the challenges and needs of normal people. The wise person shouldn't bother with actual improvement of understanding, so I am not going to discuss how to do that, only how to appear that you have done that.

* Explicitly stated thesis / Ambiguous moving point
* Use of clear words / Jargon and Acronyms
* Explain with reason and evidence / Name drop famous people
* Succinct / Word salad

Remember we want to obfuscate, not illuminate.

Occasionally, true intellectuals will wander out of their hovels into the sunlight and attempt to share their discoveries of improved models with others. This is often awkward and confusing, even though they are trying their best. Gaining a new model is a difficult process. We can use that to our advantage! Deliberately sowing confusion is fun and easy and nearly indistinguishable from a poor communicator earnestly attempting to share unfamiliar concepts.

True intellectuals will blatantly state what they are attempting to communicate. Those fools just lay all their cards on the table for everyone to see.

A true intellectual will blame themselves if you don't understand. They'll try to be clearer and think of better examples to illustrate their point. Pseudointellectuals will blame the listener, insisting they are too stupid to get their brilliance. They will recommend that the listener read an impossible amount of literature or spend an impractical amount of time becoming an "expert" like themselves. Pseudointellectuals will always place the burden of comprehension and evidence on others.
